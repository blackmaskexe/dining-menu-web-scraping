## Purpose of the script:
- Web scrape the contents of the menu at dining locations at St. Thomas
- Be able to handle dynamic table content, and store data gracefully (into a format that can be easily converted to JSON)

## Notes while using this scaping tool:
- This scraper is sensitive to changes to the dining menu website:
    - html tag and attribute changes might break the functionality of the scraper
    - potential fixes to this could be using an AI call to parse the content of the page at once (running it even once a day would cost next to nothing!)
